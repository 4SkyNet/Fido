\subsection{Q-Learning}

Reinforcement learning seeks to find the optimal action to be undertaken for a given state through trial and error. In the context of Fido, an action can be the playing of a note or driving straight forward, and the state can be the amount of light detected by the robot or how near the robot is to another object. Once an action is performed, a reward and a new state are given back to the reinforcement learning algorithm. Overtime as actions are performed, a reinforcement learning algorithm sharpens its ability to receive reward.

$Q$-Learning (Watkins, 1989) is a popular reinforcement learning algorithm that works by learning an action-value function $Q$ that takes an state-action pair as an input and outputs an expected utility value of performing that action in that state. This utility value is know as the $Q$-value. The $Q$-value is a combination of immediate reward and expected future reward. Every reward iteration, the $Q$-value of an state-action pair is updated as such:

\begin{equation}
	Q(a, s) := Q(a, s)(1 - \alpha) + \alpha(R + \gamma \max Q(a, s_{t+1}))
	\,,
\end{equation}

Where $a$ is the action carried out, $s$ is the initial state, $R$ is the reward received, and $s_{t+1}$ is the new state. $\alpha$ is the learning rate of the algorithm. The learning rate determines the rate of convergence by diminishing or amplifying the changes made to the $Q$-value each reward iteration. $\gamma$ is the devaluation factor, which determines the weight given to future rewards. A devaluation factor approaching zero will force the algorithm to only value immediate reward, while a devaluation factor approaching one will make it focused on high long term reward.


$Q$-learning in its simplest form uses a table compute $Q$-values, by storing past state-action pairs and each pair's respective $Q$-value. However, this strategy lacks scalability. In large state-action spaces, such as those that Fido will have to perform in, the amount of data and computation needed to maintain such a table renders such a strategy impractical. Since Fido will be working in large state-action space, it is necessary to use a function approximator to model $Q$. A feedforward neural network was chosen for this task, because of its ability to model non-linear functions, its lightweight performance, and its trainablility.
