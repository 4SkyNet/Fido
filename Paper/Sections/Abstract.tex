\begin{abstract}

A robot control system was developed that can be taught tasks through reinforcement learning.  The system, nicknamed Fido, was designed to be universal regardless of the specific hardware inputs and outputs, and does not need to be modified for the task at hand.  This was achieved through the training of artificial neural networks using a modified wire-fitted $Q$-learning implementation.  A kinematically accurate robot was simulated with a differential drive system, a sensor array, and other outputs.  The robot was successfully trained to do an array of tasks with limited feedback iterations, such as following a radio emitter and blinking a light-emitting diode.  A printed circuit board has been designed for Fido's hardware implementation, the next step in further research.
