The Executive Summary on its own, separate from the Research Report, should convey the essence of your project and should be understood by someone without scientific expertise. Do not simply replicate what you wrote in your Abstract. The summary should clearly present three content areas - the question asked, the methods used and the lessons learned and must be written in layperson (non-specialist) language. NOTE: The summary will be used to explain your project to the general public and in preparing press releases for the media.

\noindent

A robot intelligence can be simplified into a black box, with inputs such as sensor data and outputs such as motor control.  The purpose of this project was to develop an intelligence that not only can adapt to any set of robot inputs and outputs, but can also be trained using reinforcement learning.  This was achieved by simulating artificial neural networks,
