# Paper Outline

### Introduction

### Neural Network Background

### Q-Learning
- Descrete Q-learning
- Wire fitted q-learning

### Novel Reinforcement Learning Implementation

### Simulator
- Speak about reason for building the simulator
  - It allows us to prototype without having to build a hardware implementation
- Simulator Functionality
  - Sensor that have been implemented
  - Kinematic model with magnetic monopoles

### Results
- Tasks that Fido has learned
  - Turning on an LED when given the proper stimulus
  - Driving straight
  - Driving towards a magnetic field
  - Driving quickly
- Results when taught by a machine
  - Number of reward iterations needed
  - Time needed each reward iteration
- Results when taught by humans
  - Number of reward iteration needed
  - Time needed each reward iteration
- Comparison to other implementations

### Future Work
- Hardware Implementation

### Conclusion
