In practice most robot control systems are procedural programmed systems; conditional logic is executed linearly to emulate a desired behavior.  Structures such as functions, if statements, and classes are used to implement the ability for a robot to perform a desired task.   While this method may be sufficient for performing repetitive logic-based tasks such as line-following, it is clearly not scalable to higher level intelligent functionality.   Additionally, this system lacks the ability to interact with its operator, and will always perform the same task rather than  dynamically adjusting its task based on further training.  Finally,
