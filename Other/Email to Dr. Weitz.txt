Hello Dr. Weitz,

I hope you've had a great summer.  Myself and Michael Truell are excited to be in your Science Research half-credit next year, and have been working on a project for NYCSEF over the summer. 

Our concept is to use simulated neural networks and machine learning techniques to teach a robotic device to react and respond to sensor inputs.  By precoding certain inputs as positive stimuli and others as negative stimuli, we hope to be able to "train" this robotic device and observe how it behaves over time.  An arbitrary example in our current conceptual model is that intensity of infrared light could be a positive stimulus.  We could use an infrared LED to teach our neural networks to perform an action (such as using its piezo buzzer or moving its motors) by strategically providing and removing an IR led. 

Up to this point we have done research practicing implementing different types of learning systems for neural networks in order to decide which best fit our needs.  We taught a neural network to play tic-tac-toe using methods such as Genetic Algorithms, Backpropogation, and Q-learning.  We've also been working on an electronic schematic for the hardware implementation, and are about to begin routing a printed circuit board for the robot.

We thought that we would update you with our progress as the school year comes (unfortunately) close.  Thank you, and we look forward to any feedback you may have.

Sincerely,
Joshua Gruenstein and Michael Truell
