# Unit Testing
To unit test Fido, we use the [Catch](https://github.com/philsquared/Catch "Catch") C++ Unit Testing Framework.
In order to run our tests, compile with `make`, and run using `./test`.
To have more control over the tests, read [this page](https://github.com/philsquared/Catch/blob/master/docs/command-line.md "Command Line Arguments")  on command line arguments for the unit tests.
