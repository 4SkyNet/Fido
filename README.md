# Fido

An open-source, highly modular C++ machine learning library for embedded electronics and robotics. Fido includes implementations of neural networks, reinforcement learning, and genetic algorithms. Fido is especially suited for robotic contexts, as it is written in C++ with minimal use of the standard library, comes packaged with a robotic simulator, and provides and easy interface in which to write robotic drivers.

## Getting Started

Clone the github repository.
```
$ git clone https://github.com/FidoProject/Fido.git
```

Move to the Software directory and build the library using cmake.
```
cd Fido/Software && make .
```

Now you may use Fido in your C++ projects, by including any of the header files located in the Software directory.
