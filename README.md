# Fido

![build status](https://travis-ci.org/FidoProject/Fido.svg?branch=master)

Fido is an open-source, highly modular C++ machine learning library for embedded electronics and robotics. Fido is especially suited for robotic and embedded contexts, as it is written in C++ with minimal use of the standard library, comes packaged with a robotic simulator, and provides and easy interface in which to write robotic drivers.

Check out the [project site](http://fidoproject.github.io/) for details.
